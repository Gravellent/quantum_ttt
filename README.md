# Quantum Tic Tac Toe

This is a Fall 2020 Deep Learning Final Project. 

The repo consists of player, state, and a Jupyter notebook to interpret the result. 

Some of the result can be found in the "League_result" folder, where different agents play against each other. 

`State` package contains all three different States, the normal TTT, superposition TTT, and the quantum TTT.
`Player` pacakge contains different players under different states, include agent, random player and human players.
`model.py` contains the models used in the experiment, including linear models and multiple neural networks. 
`demo.ipynb` contains the version we trail we run to analyze performance.
`Group Stage.ipynb` contains the necessary steps to run the group stage experiment
